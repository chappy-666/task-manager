## 📌 Status

Paused development as I shift focus to React + Tailwind UI prototyping, but this project remains available as a reference.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [Angular](https://angular.io/) 19+
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
- Angular Signals
- TypeScript
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## 🐳 Dev Container Ready

This project includes a pre-configured [Dev Container](https://containers.dev/) environment using **VS Code Remote - Containers**.  
No need to install Angular or Node.js locally — just open in VS Code and start coding!

### Quick Start (VS Code)

#### 🧪 Open in Dev Container

1. Make sure you have:

   - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
   - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) running

2. Open the project folder in VS Code

3. When prompted, click **"Reopen in Container"**

That’s it! The container will automatically:

- Install Node.js and dependencies
- Set up Angular CLI
- Use `.devcontainer` settings and extensions

## 🚀 Planned Features

- [x] 🗂️ Add, edit, and delete tasks
- [x] ✅ Update task completion status
- [x] Filter and search tasks by status
- [x] Responsive design (mobile-friendly)

## ⚙️ Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chappy-666/task-manager.git
cd task-manager

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the dev server
npm run dev

# Open in your browser

```

## 🤝 Why It Matters

While this project is not production-ready, it reflects my growing expertise with Angular's modern capabilities, including Signals and architectural best practices. Future projects will build on the lessons learned here.
